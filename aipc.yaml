project:
  name: Flood detection
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >
    This project focuses on flood detection and analysis using satellite imagery 
    (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2). It calculates NDWI and visualizes flood-prone areas, 
    storing results as raster and vector data for further geospatial analysis.

  repository: https://github.com/Munazaa/Flood-Mapping-Case.git
dependencies:
  python:
    - geemap >= 0.14.0
    - earthengine-api >= 0.1.345
    - matplotlib >= 3.5.0
    - pandas >= 1.3.0
  earthengine:
    datasets:
      - COPERNICUS/S1_GRD
      - COPERNICUS/S2_SR
      - JRC/GSW1_0/GlobalSurfaceWater
      - UCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/PENTAD

workflow:
  - Step 1: Authenticate Google Earth Engine
  - Step 2: Load Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for defined AOI
  - Step 3: Preprocess data (cloud masking, smoothing, slope filtering)
  - Step 4: Compute NDWI and flood extent
  - Step 5: Visualize results in Jupyter Notebook
  - Step 6: Export results (vector and raster) to Google Drive

outputs:
  vector: Google Drive (Shapefiles for flood-affected areas)
  raster: Google Drive (GeoTIFF files for flood extent)

notes:
  - Post-processing is ongoing to improve flood detection accuracy.
  - Results are compatible with geospatial tools like QGIS and ArcGIS.
