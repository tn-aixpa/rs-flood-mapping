# Flood-Mapping-Case
Visualization and Analysis of Floods Using Earth Engine and Geemap.

## Requirements
To follow this tutorial, you must first [sign up](https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) for a [Google Earth Engine account](https://earthengine.google.com/). Earth Engine is a cloud computing platform with a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It is free for noncommercial use. To authenticate the Earth Engine Python API, see instructions [here](https://book.geemap.org/chapters/01_introduction.html#earth-engine-authentication).

In this tutorial, we will use the [geemap](https://geemap.org/) Python package to visualize and analyze the Pakistan floods. Geemap enables users to analyze and visualize Earth Engine datasets interactively within a Jupyter-based environment with minimal coding. To learn more about geemap, check out https://geemap.org.

To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
